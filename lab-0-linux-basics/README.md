# Lab 0 – Linux Server Basics & Initial Security Awareness

## Objective
Understand the fundamentals of a Linux server environment, focusing on user management, privilege separation, and initial security awareness.

## Steps Performed
- Verified usage of a non-root user for daily operations
- Configured sudo privileges for controlled administrative access
- Checked SSH service status and default behavior
- Reviewed authentication logs to understand login and sudo activity
- Explored basic service management concepts (`start`, `enable`, `status`)

## Security Notes
- Using a non-root user reduces the impact of potential privilege abuse
- Awareness of SSH service state is essential before exposing a system to a network
- Authentication logs provide visibility into access-related events
- Understanding service management is critical for secure system administration

## Status
✅ Completed
