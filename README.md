# Cloud Security Labs

Hands-on cloud and Linux security labs focused on secure server configuration, access control, and cloud security fundamentals.

This repository documents my practical learning journey in cloud and infrastructure security through real system hardening exercises.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Build strong Linux and cloud security fundamentals
- Understand common infrastructure attack vectors
- Apply security best practices through hands-on labs
- Create a documented security learning portfolio

---

## Focus Areas

- Linux server hardening
- Secure remote access (SSH)
- Identity and access control
- Networking and firewall fundamentals
- Cloud security foundations (AWS-focused)
- Misconfiguration awareness and mitigation

## Lab Index

| Lab | Title | Focus |
|----|------|------|
| Lab 0 | [Linux Server Basics & User Management](./lab-0-linux-basics) | Users, permissions, service awareness |
| Lab 1 | [SSH Hardening & Secure Access Control](./lab-1-ssh-hardening) | SSH security, key-based auth |
| Lab 2 | [Firewall & Network Hardening](./lab-2-firewall-hardening/README.md) | iptables, default-deny networking |

> Each lab includes documentation, security rationale, and verification steps.

## Learning Approach

- Labs are intentionally small and focused
- Security decisions are explained, not just applied
- Verification steps are always included to confirm correctness
- Emphasis is placed on **why** a configuration matters

All configurations were performed in isolated lab environments.
